I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Professor Lu Su. I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from New York University and my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Dalian University of Technology. My research primarily focuses on wireless sensing and computer vision. Currently, I am working on enhancing the generalizability of deep learning models for wireless sensing data.
